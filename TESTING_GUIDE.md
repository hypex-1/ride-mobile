## 🔄 PHASE 3: Real-Time Communication Testing

### **Backend Log Monitoring**
While testing, watch terminal for these key events:

**Rider Side:**
```
LOG 🚗 REQUESTING RIDE - Original data: {...}
LOG ✅ Ride requested successfully: {...}
LOG 🚫 cancelRide called with: {...}
```

**Driver Side:**
```
LOG 👤 Joining room for User ID: 4, Role: DRIVER
LOG 📍 Emitting driver location: {...}
LOG 🔔 DRIVER: Incoming ride request received: {...}
```

**Socket Events:**
```
LOG 🔌 Socket connected
LOG 🔧 Setting up enhanced socket listeners
```

### **Test Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Rider Requests, Driver Accepts**
1. Login as rider → request ride → note ride ID
2. Switch to driver → go online → should see mock acceptance
3. Check logs for ride state changes

**Scenario 2: Multiple Ride Cycles**
1. As rider: Request → Cancel → Request again
2. Switch to driver: Check for multiple ride notifications
3. Verify no memory leaks or stuck states

**Scenario 3: Network Resilience**
1. Turn off WiFi briefly during ride request
2. ✅ **Verify**: App handles gracefully with mock data
3. Turn WiFi back on
4. ✅ **Verify**: Reconnects properly
