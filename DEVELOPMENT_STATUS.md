### 💰 Payment Implementation Details

**Default Payment Flow:**
- ✅ Cash on Delivery as default payment method
- ✅ Automatic payment logging on ride completion via `/payments/log`
- ✅ Receipt generation and display with payment breakdown
- ✅ Payment method selection during ride booking

**Future-Proof Features:**
- 🔄 Digital Wallet integration (UI ready, marked "Coming Soon")
- 🔄 Credit/Debit Card payments (UI ready, marked "Coming Soon")
- ✅ Extensible payment method architecture

**Backend Requirements:**
```javascript
// POST /payments/log - Log payment after ride completion
{
  rideId: string,
  amount: number,
  method: "CASH" | "DIGITAL_WALLET" | "CARD",
  currency?: string, // defaults to "TND"
  metadata?: object
}

// GET /payments/:rideId - Get payment receipt
// Returns: PaymentReceipt with ride details, driver info, payment breakdown

// GET /payments/history - Get user payment history
// Returns: Array of PaymentLog objects
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ Node.js test script: `node testPayments.js`
- ✅ Backend endpoint documentation with request/response examples
- ✅ Mobile app payment flow integration testing
